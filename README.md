so i downloaded the free vpn extension available for chrome , i connect to a vpn with random country available and check my ip on whatismyipaddress website and my ip changed then i tried to surf some website i found that website is working slow as compared to without vpn and language of website is automatically changed acc to the vpn country i connected with .

so basically vpn encrypt the data and hides our real ip so webiste cant read our data .

benefits are it hides our ip , bypass geological restriction , secure our data encryption
limitation are slow internet and doesnt protect against malware, phishing and unsafe websites
